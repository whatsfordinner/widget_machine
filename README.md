# Widget Machine

The widget machine is a largely pointless application I'm building to help myself get better at Python _and_ form the basis of an application to deploy infrastructure around.  

## Scenario

The widget machine is a basic application used by a widget factory to provide users:  
* a way of querying existing widgets and the available stock
* a way of ordering more widgets
* creating new widgets

It will be deployed into an 'on premises' environment that is to be managed by Ansible.
